# Project Ocular Echo

This is our entry for Cutie Hack IV at University of California Riverside. It is an Arduino-based detection system to assist the visually impaired. 
Normally, canes can be used to assist in navigation of the visually impaired. While this works for obstacles below waist level, anything above waist level becomes harder to detect. 
In countries that lack accommodations for the visually impaired, canes can only do so much. Collisions with parked vehicles would occur as the userâ€™s cane would go underneath a car or bus, giving the user false information. They would then collide with the vehicle. 
For our demo, we have the device attached to our feet, but the idea can be applied to any part of the body, such as the chest or arms. With the proper modules, we could have more accurate sensors that would provide feedback on environmental obstacles. 
We would sell the setup as a kit. It would contain a rechargeable battery bank to power the unit, the microcontroller, sensors, motors, and wires. The battery bank and controller can attach to a belt or be placed in a pocket. The motors and sensors would be attached to the controller via wires. They would attach to the user with a Velcro band.
